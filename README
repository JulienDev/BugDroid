BugDroid
===========

BugDroid is a mobile client for Bugzilla.
Bugzilla is an open source bug tracker application from the Mozilla foundation.

Current features :
* Personal dashboard
* List bugs by products
* Quick access to a bug by ID / summary
* Display a bug (attachments, details, comments, ccs)
* Connect to your account
* Bookmark bugs
* Handle the bugzilla urls located in external applications (only for b.m.o instance)

There is a lot of work to do (Edit a bug, Make advanced searches, ...), but as I am designing the app on my spare time I don't have a lot of time to work on it.

How to build
===========

Import project using Android Studio, build, play
